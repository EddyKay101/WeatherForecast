## Weather Forecast App

This is an app which consumes the darksky api.

## Third party apis consumed:
  - Darksky APi

  - Google geolocation api in order to allow user to search for location as Darksky only accepts coordinates.

  - Guzzle in order to consume the apis

This app was created with minimal styling due to time constraints.

There are areas for improvement but as this is an mvp it is created with it's sole objective to capture data and display it back to the user.

It contains hourly and weekly weather data.

There is a login process before you get to see the data. You can use these credentials:

edwardkay10@gmail.com - username
password = Password

The SQL file is attached in order to make it easier to import instead of creating tables from scratch.
